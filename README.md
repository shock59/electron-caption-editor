# Caption Editor

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This app is still a work in progress and most features have not been implemented yet! You will not be able to use it to actually get work done.

Caption Editor is an app that allows you to write closed captions/subtitles for videos.

Having captions available for videos is really important for accessibility, but unfortunately many of the tools currently out there for writing them are very old with ugly and confusing interfaces. This app aims to have a more modern and easy to use interface so that anyone can easily write captions. The app is built with web technologies such as Svelte and Electron to make it work on all desktop operating systems.

Currently most features are not implemented, you can find a rough plan on what needs to be added in [TODO.md](TODO.md).
